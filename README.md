### Crop-condition
Several factors such as availability of water, soil fertility, protecting crops from rodents, timely use of pesticides & other useful chemicals and nature have remarkable 
impact on crop production. While a lot of these factors are difficult to control for, the amount and frequency of pesticides is something the farmer can control.
Pesticides protect the crop with the right dosage. But, if farmer add more than required, they may spoil the entire harvest. 
A high level of pesticide can deem the crop dead / unsuitable for consumption among many outcomes.
